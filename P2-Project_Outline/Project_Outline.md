# 1. Foedsel, the birthing app for midwives
Timing contractions is where many apps start, but Foedsel goes further. Instead of ads for diapers and formula, Foedsel enables midwives to record contractions, and timestamp important events that happen during the birth.

# 2. Features

- time contractions
- record time of events:
    - pushing
    - water broke
    - head visible
- reminders:
    - _once the head comes out, call time every 30 seconds, until the baby comes out_ (e.g., "1 minute, 30 seconds")
    - _once the baby comes out, call time every 30 seconds
- save data **securely** for later export/integration into medical records

# 3. Technologies
It may be

- React Native (aka Javascript)

or

- Xamarin

# 4. What I'll Have To Learn

I don't currently know how to respond to browser / UI events. My knowledge ends at HTML form submissions handled by Flask/Python or C#/.Net controllers. Learning to implement this level of interactivity will be the primary learning done here.

maybe time contractions
buttons to push for milestones in labor that just

timemarks things like pushing, water broke, head visible
and then once the head comes out, I want it to call time

0:00:45

every 30 seconds until the whole baby
comes out, and then we can maybe push another button
that starts calling time again, every thirty seconds, until we stop it
because that way we can keep track of our APGAR scours

and then if the baby needs some help somebody is available not keeping track of time.

the most important times in labor really are like once the head is out, because...if the shoulders are stuck, that's a problem

so once the head is out, it's important to know time because if she's not having a contraction, it's fine, but if she is, we need to be aware of that

and then once the whole baby is out, becasuse you want them crying within one minute
